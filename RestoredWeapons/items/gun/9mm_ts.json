        "description": "An incredibly rare German automatic firearm developed by Hugo Schmeisser whilst working under Bergmann Waffenfabrik during 1918; the MP 18 holds the reputation of being the world's first proper and practical submachine gun.  Chambered for 9x19mm and designed for use in close quarters trench-based combat by assault troops, a role in which it excelled, the weapon was outlawed from military use by the Versailles treaty and was relegated to police and counterinsurgency use in the interwar period.  More than likely entering the US as a personal holdover from the Great War, this century-old grandfather to most classic SMGs just might be better off coming out of retirement now that the world's entered the true greatest war."

However, what rests before you is not an original production C96, but rather a modern American spin on the original Mauser recipe.  Feeding from detachable box magazines rather than an internal clip, the M714 is crafted out of a mix of modern and surplus parts, being chambered for 9x19mm rounds, with some other models being offered in the Mauser's own 7.63x25mm cartridge."
