Each tube must be loaded separately, but this offers the option of loading different ammunition for different situations.  As the weapon's trigger is situated forwards of the chamber in what is termed as a 'bullpup' design, the firearm's still only as long as conventional shotguns despite having a comparatively far higher capacity.",
